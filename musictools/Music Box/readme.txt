| documentations.  A  must  have  for  GameBoy Color and GameBoy developers, |
| hobby  programmers  and  composers.  The  system  can be licensed together |
| with  its  next  generation,  more  advanced  PC  version,  Music Box 2 to |
| commercial  games,  demos  and  tools too and can be freely used in public |
| domain  games,  demos  and  tools.  For  more  informations read the large |

| The  system  runs  on  the real target machine, the GameBoy Color (in full |
| colours)  or the classic GameBoy (in greyscale). So the composer will hear |
| really  the same the gamer will in the end product. Also this system makes |
| it  possible  to  compose  music outdoors what can be great fun. Even your |
| kids will like it.                                                         |

| Some  more brief infos about the system. It is possible to make multispeed |
| music  with  the  system  and  it doesn't need too much CPU time and other |
| system  resources.  Also  it is using all the four channels for both music |
| and  soundeffects (including the third wavetable channel). The size of the |
| music is also really small.                                                |

| "My  GB  is your GB and your GB is my GB" is the first GameBoy Color intro |
| from  Black  Box,  Resource  and  Success  and The Ruling Company. It is a |
| really  fastmade  small  and  simple C64 crackintro like oldskool intro to |
| demonstrate our musicsystem "Music Box". Playing a multispeed music "Noisy |
| Pillars"  (original  version  was  composed  by Jeroen "Wave" Tel) done by |
| Fusion  with our own "Music Box" tracker. So this is really simple, anyway |
| I hope you like it.                                                        |

| This  is  my  second scene release this year and my second console release |

| Use  this  intro  on  a  real GameBoy Color (it is GameBoy Color only) and |
| don't  use  emulators. If you really don't have any possibility to use the |
| real  thing  then  use  only the latest NO$GMB emulator. If you like small |
