About

The Game Boy Sound Manipulator is a Game Boy program that allows the user to easily experiment with the different sound settings for Game Boy’s four types of sounds.

This tool is targeted at Game Boy programmers, so you will have to know some about Game Boy registers and programming for this to be useful for you.

Basically, however, once you’ve made a sound you like you simply copy the four or five bytes shown in the display to the appropriate registers during your Game Boy program. For example Sound 1 has to have its values loaded into ($ff10) – ($ff14) and then the sound will automatically play.

Requirements

The Game Boy Sound Manipulator is made for Game Boy Color. It works best if you can burn it on a cartridge and run it on the real thing. Accurate audio performance on emulators will vary.
