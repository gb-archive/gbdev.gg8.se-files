First things first! - Have you ever tracked music before?
If the answer is yes, then you will find this relatively easy to get into,
especially if you have used Amiga Sound/Protracker, PC Screamtracker III or
PC Fast Tracker II before.

If the answer is no, then you'll have to do some practicing on PC based
tracker and Beyond Tracker side by side, moving straight to doing 4 channel
gameboy music is quite a difficult thing to do, but if you must, then have a
go!  What have you got to lose?

One very important point is even if you have done a lot of tracking before:
the gameboy has only 4 channels of sound making equipment.  So if you are used
to 64 channels of filtered stereophonic surround sound, you have a lot of
adjustments to make if you want to master composing for this console.

You have to remember that gameboy (from here referred to as GBC) music making
is all about optimization of sound.  It's not the most powerful of sound
hardware, coming in with about half the capabilities of the c64 SID chip.

Second things last! - Read the following few chapters, jumping right in and
trying to make GBC music without reading these docs will result in audio
pain and possibly deafness.  :)

Here are some specifications on the Gameboy Color architecture:

CPU: modified Z80 (missing and/or new opcodes)

GB and GB pocket:
  4K +128 Bytes of ram
  4 Mhz (some say 1Mhz since all opcodes take a multiple of 4 cycles)
GB Color:
  32K +128 Bytes of ram
  4Mhz (1Mhz) or 8Mhz (2Mhz) selectable

All:
  Custom sound circuitry with 4 generators.


These in turn are compromised of:

CHANNEL | TYPE
#1| Square wave *4 types see diagrams below, plus frequency sweep
#2| Square wave *4 types... no frequency sweep
#3| Wave Channel. Can load a wave of 32bytes or a series of 32b waves
#4| NOIZZZZE



SQUARE WAVE DUTY SHAPES:

00:					01:
--------------------------------        --------------------------------
   #############################        	########################
   #						#
   #						#
   #						#
####					#########
--------------------------------        --------------------------------


02:					03: (opposite of wave 01)
--------------------------------        --------------------------------

		#						    #
		#						    #

#################			#############################
--------------------------------        --------------------------------



Now you see how the GBC makes its beep and blurp noises!  The next question is
what the does the wave channel do?  That's a tricky question to answer, the
best answer is, not much.

You 'can' mangle it into actually sounding very nice, as some people know, but
it takes practice.  For the purpose of this particular document I won't get
into the wave channel too much, as that really should be covered in its
own FAQ.

The noise channel is another matter all together, it really does only what
it says on the tin, it produces noise, lots of it.  Using the extended
features of the tracker you can produce some very effective noise instruments
like kickdrums, snares, hihats and aphex twin style gurglegrumble noises.

As I explain it further down into the document, the noise channel isn't as
useless as you first think.

   yymmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmlt.`4kmmmmmmmmmmmmmNNN ll  i    ;        .

Just to recap, GBC music is based on 4channels of sound; two square wave
channels, one wave channel, and one noise channel.


- Channel 1 is identical to Channel 2 with the following exception:
   Channel 1 has a frequency sweep function that channel 2 doesn't have.
   That function can be used to create a similar basedrum so channel 1 might
   be better used on music than SoundFX.

- The envelope speed and direction can be changed when the channel is still
  playing.  If it reach volume zero, changing the envelope wont work.
  Instead, if the new setting is volume slide UP, volume will jump to 14
  (0x0E) and stay there; if the new setting is volume slide DOWN, volume will
  increase by 2 and stay there.
  The current playing volume won't change unless the channel is restarted.

____________________________________________________
*- channel's 1 and 2 are Square wave generators:
____________________________________________________
    -volume envelope functions
    -4 pulse width settings: 0: -_______ (12%)
                             1: --______ (25%)
                             2: ----____ (50%)
                             3: ------__ (75%)
    -free frequency setting of about 6 octaves wide
    -only channel 1 has a frequency sweep function (slide up or down of pitch)
____________________________________________________
*- channel 3 is a digital wave loop output, it has:
____________________________________________________
    -only 4 volume settings: full (100%), half (50%), quarter (25%) and silent
     (0%)
    -only 32 samples of 4 bits in a loop, to allow making of about any
     waveform
    -you can trick channel 3 into playing long (more than 32smp) digital
     sounds but the channel needs to be stopped, reloaded with the next 32
     samples, then restarted adding terrible glitches on the audio
    -none of the volume envelope functions
    -free frequency setting of about 6 octaves wide (MUCH BETTER FOR BASE)
____________________________________________________
channel 4 is a noise generator it has:
____________________________________________________
    -volume envelope functions
    -2 operating modes: 15 steps mode and 7 steps mode,
     the 15 steps mode sound like noise
     the 7 steps mode sound more like a buzz
    -limited frequency settings using 2 variables:
     X- 0 to 13
     Y- 0 to 7    (for this 0 is considered like 0.5)

     freq = (262144Hz / Y) SHR X

     (SHR X means Shift Right (divided by '2 to the power of X') )

     That gives the noise speed (at which rate the noise changes) but just
     play around with the settings until you find the noise pitch you want.

     X settings below 4 or 5 don't show up on the tracker because of the
     44Khz mixing rate.

     The gameboy has a much higher rate so it does make a difference on the
     console.

     Overall, the settings above are filtered by both the ear and internal
     speaker &amp; filter giving a softer white noise, but it doesn't sound
     higher pitched than a setting of 4.


volume envelope functions are the following:
     -starting volume, from 0 to 15 (0 to F)
     -volume slide Up or Down
     -number of frames for every volume changes (0 to 7)
      (there are 60 frames per second, 16.67ms)

Instrument, wave and pattern names must be a 1 or 2 digit hex number followed
by a ':' and an optional text name if the hex number is longer than two
digits, not followed by a ':' or invalid the item wont be exported (useful
to disable/swap instruments).

Instrument and soundFX names have to be valid assembler labels, that is:
  - no spaces
  - letters A-Z, a-z (case sensitive)
  - numbers 0-9
  - underscore allowed '_'

Instrument/SFX editor keys:
        ------------------------------------------------------
        Alt+Space    -  Test SoundFX (no specified note)
        Alt+NoteKey  -  Test Instrument/SoundFX (with specified note)

        Ctrl+Shift+S -  Save current instrument (IGB format)
        Ctrl+O       -  Open &amp; Insert instrument (IGB format)
        Ctrl+E       -  Export Instrument/SFX Bank
        ------------------------------------------------------
  Alt+space normally plays the instrument at &quot;C&quot; or at the last note
  you played via ALT+NoteKey.  IGB format is the proprietary format
  for saving instruments.


Instrument list:
        ------------------------------------------------------
        Insert       -  Insert a new instrument after the current
        Shift+Insert -  Insert a new instrument before the current
        Alt+Del      -  Delete current instrument
        ------------------------------------------------------

Instrument editor:
        ------------------------------------------------------
        Insert       - Insert an empty row in the current channel before
                        the current row
        Shift+Insert - Insert an empty row in the current channel after
                        the current row
        Alt+Del      - Delete a row in the current channel
        ------------------------------------------------------
  The above keys are ones you will have to get very used to, its worth
  printing out this section of the documentation for familiarizing
  yourself with the Keyboard layout.

____________________________________________________
F4 -&gt; Wave editor keys -
____________________________________________________

        Ctrl+Shift+S -  Save current audio wave (AGB format)

        Ctrl+I       -  Import &amp; Insert audio wave (8 bit unsigned raw)
        ------------------------------------------------------
    (AGB format is what the tracker saves you samples into natively.)

    (Saving an 8-bit sample is useful as you can use something like goldwave
     -www.goldwave.com- to open and edit your wave, then simply re-insert
      once you have finished your editing.)

Instruments are reordered on export so its fine to have them disordered in
the instrument list and unused instrument numbers take space (8 bytes) in
the instrument table, that is until I add song size optimizing functions
for example if two instruments are used:

&quot;0:inst_A&quot;
&quot;2:inst_B&quot;

This will create an empty instrument &quot;1:&quot; adding 8 useless bytes in the
instrument table (unless that is wanted, for example: using instrument 1 in
the song, with #1 being empty could allow for later instrument bank swapping
for different song mood)

Instrument numbers are in HEX (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f, etc -&gt; FF)

Names will be prefixed by &quot;SFX_&quot; when exported (that is &quot;1:ping&quot; in the
tracker will become &quot;SFX_ping EQU 1&quot; in the exported .inc file)

Song making tip: just use all of these existing instrument examples - and
construct a simple tune, maybe use some simple cords / arps (like L37 for 16
rows then L38 for 16 then L47 for 32rows) with the pulser instrument...


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Invalid names simply wont be exported... &lt;&lt;&lt;-- REMEMBER THIS!!!

The best way for you to learn about note effects in gameboy tracking is to
simply check out the simple demo tunes which are supplied with this document,
check through the tune and look at the different effects and how they affect
playback. Also check the next section as it details every bit of the songs
creation. GOOD LUCK! :)

This guide assumes that you actually know how to operate the tracker via the
KB and also that you have messed around with the example instruments and tune.
If you haven't done these things, do them now before reading on, otherwise
you'll get horribly confused :)

DISCLAIMER: These are my personal views on GBC tracking, maybe you won't
agree with them, but they are only here to get people started.  Hopefully
they'll form a decent basis for beginners and experienced trackers alike.

First off, the gameboy music chip is very underpowered, remember this.
It was designed this way so as to reduce manufacturing cost and to be
battery power conscious.

It doesn't have strong bass, and using realistic sounding samples in your own
tunes is troublesome (its not impossible - its just takes time).

However, the good thing about the GBC sound chip is that is capable of doing
a half decent c64 impression (though its not as powerful as the SID chip).
Also, you can also mangle it into sounding like a pretty good retro-techno
beatbox/synth with a little messing around.

I'm splitting this section down into areas of interest. I knocked up a tune
in 10mins to illustrate some of these points - also check out the other
couple of tunes in the package for more interesting tricks.


-a) Getting to grips with instruments and depth.
	The gameboy is a curious little machine, comprised of the classic z80
 	and a super simple sound chip.

	Firstly - get really into the instrument editor, this is really the
	heart of the program as this is where your sounds are constructed.
	Mess around on channels 1 &amp; 2 with changing the REZ (r:X x being 0-3)
	and spacing them out differently, you can create nice cheap filtering
	fx with this sort of thing.  Check the example tune, the lead sample
	is simple - but when mixed into the tune gives the music a lot more
	depth.

	To make your tunes sound like anything half decent - we have to trick
	the listener into thinking more is happening within the tune.
	As we are limited to 4 channels, then 3 with actual note data - we
	have to rely on things like fill noise instruments and arpeggio
        sounds.

        Check the example tune, there are two levels of arps running at the
	same time, giving the listener a lot to listen to, some of the other
	example tunes are even more heavily reliant on arps and fills than
	the example tune.  Remember though to spend time trying to give your
	tunes depth - 4channels of sound is quite limiting - but it can also
	force you to work harder and produce more interesting sounds and FX.

-b) Percussion on the GBC
	There are two schools of thought on this one.
		1. Do I use channel 1 or channel 4 or even channel 3
        	2. Use everything.
	The only answer to which is better is really within your own head,
	also its very dependant on what the project you are doing requires.
	For example one of the included tunes uses ch1 and ch4, but even
	uses high-pitched instrument drops to sound like effects.

-c) Bass
	The GBC has a low and slightly awful bass output, we can remedy this
	a bit by using nice samples on ch3 - as this channel has a much
	better frequency range than ch1+2.

-d) Manual Arps
	Whilst the tracker/player has an arp effect (LXX x being 00-&gt;FF) you
	can also (for extra effect) construct your own arps.  Make sure the
	songspeed is set to &quot;02&quot; or so, then simply select a cord (for example
        e-a-c) then arrange the notes in some order down the pattern shifting
        the rez (PXX in the channel FX).  This will create a pleasant phazing
	effect over the arp. This way you can also make more complex arps than
	the old mod arp fx effect allows.

-e) Using Arp FX for tunes
	An old amiga trick is to use an arp of CC or C0 (effect would be LCC
        or LC0 on GBC), then apply it over your tune/lead sample channel, or
	just alternate.

	Now you have some idea of what we are covering in this guide, make
	a song with the example instruments above; also try and create new
	and exciting FX based around the above tips.  Create your 1st pattern
	with a simple base line and melody, then add another pattern with
	CTRL&amp;+ keys, add in some of the example drums, then go to the order
	list editor and join the two patterns.  00,01,x (x = loop to
	start -&gt; for a loop to specific pattern put the order number here
	like x12 or something).

&gt;&gt; Hit F5 - it should play your 1st GBC 2 pattern tune. Add more to it- be
   creative, rip some of the example songs instruments and mess with them! :)
