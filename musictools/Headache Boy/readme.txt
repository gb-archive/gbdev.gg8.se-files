Unfortunately the version of 2011 version of Headacheboy that I posted doesn't
exist anymore. Its not a big loss because it didn't even worked on a real
gameboy but you can listen to how it sounded here (only the first track) 

https://mespunt.bandcamp.com/album/1096-minutes-of-headache

Its pretty funny sounding because it was recorded plugging my laptop's
headphone output into its minijack mic input so there's some distortion added
to the one VisualboyAdvance's overclocking gives. 

Fortunately HB went through some 30 minutes updates (maybe 3 or 4) during the
years , and now it's got a 'GUI' and works on real gameboys. 

Instructions:

Left/Right buttons move the arrow left and right through the channels.

Up/Down buttons move the fader of the channel up and down.

'A' button plays/stops the channel the arrow's on.

The 4th channel (CLK) is the program's clock. If you move it things are gonna
get faster (or slower) A button doesn't do anything here. 


You'll quickly realize that headache boy its not very interesting. I hope it
doesn't disappoint you! 

Cheers from Catalonia!
