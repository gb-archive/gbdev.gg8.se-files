To use software instruments a Game Boy (my own) is. 
How is intuition.

The sound Pad, A Bend in the semi-tone down, B over four times, START is the octave switch. 
SELECT + right on Duty Switch, SELECT + root switch is down. (Increased to two octaves) 
SELECT + switch on the left scale (Ionian, Lydian, Blues) is. 

Previous versions had a bug that has no sound. I'm sorry. 
This time, B has a function to raise four buttons. 
Also, Dorian scale has been changed from Lydian.



Quoting Chris, from http://handheldsound.blogspot.com:

‘Using the directional pad, the user can select and play 8 tones of a musical scale.
The A and B buttons act as pitch bend and raise the pitch by a 4th respectively.

The START button jumps up or down an octave, depending on current location.

The SELECT button in conjuction with directions allows access to base note 
(SELECT + UP or DOWN), scale(SELECT + RIGHT), and wave duty(SELECT + LEFT)

The scale options are Lydian, Dorian, and Blues.’
