Summary:
The Micromodul LX1 MIDI controller by Faderfox looks amazing.  It's a pocket-size USB
controller comprised of 64 buttons that fits overtop your laptop keyboard.
Unfortunately, as of this writing, it costs over $200US.

So, instead of paying that, I'm building a Gameboy application that emulates the
functionality of the Micromodul LX1 for the greatest price of all: free.  This
application will be comprised of a screen with a matrix of virtual "buttons".  In
addition, a Microsoft Windows driver will be made to convert the data generated by
the Gameboy into MIDI data usable by PC applications.  The PC Linker Gameboy
port-to-parallel port cable will be utilized to transfer data from the Gameboy to a
PC, where the Microsoft Windows driver will perform the necessary transformations.


Development:
[006.026.2008]
The initial version is complete and a distribution is now available.  The distribution 
contains 3 files: faderfoxjr.gb, faderfoxjrtranslator.exe, and a copy of this README.  
Faderfox JR utilizes the Gameboy port-to-parallel port cable that came with the PC Linker.  
As such, this will only work on a Windows PC with a parallel port.  If you do not have the 
Gameboy port-to-parallel port cable, there are instructions for building one at Brian 
Provinciano site at bripro.com.  It is also very likely that you will need to download 
inpout32.dll, which is available for free at various sites on the internet.  It is not 
included in the Faderfox JR distribution to avoid any potential licensing issues.

faderfoxjr.gb is the Gameboy image.  Simply transfer it to a Gameboy cartridge in the same 
manner that you would use with any other Gameboy image or rom.  See devrs.com or 
reinerziegler.de for information about running Gameboy images/roms on a Gameboy if you are 
not already familiar with the various means of doing so.

faderfoxjrtranslator.exe is a Windows application that will turn the data sent from the
Gameboy into MIDI data.  To use Faderfox JR, start this program and answer the prompts.
Then, connect the Gameboy port-to-parallel port cable from the Gameboy port to your PC's
parallel port.  Finally, with a cartridge containing faderfoxjr.gb loaded, turn on your 
Gameboy.  If all goes according to plan, the Gameboy and PC will initialize communication
and you will be presented with the first screen: the Micromodul LX1 emulation.

Use the directional button to choose a control element on the screen.  Press A to activate
on-screen buttons.  To turn knobs, hold down A and press up or down to adjust the value 
by 1.  Hold down A and press left or right to adjust the value 20.  To move the crossfader 
on the Faderfox DJ1 emulation screen, hold down A and press up or down to move the crossfader
a fraction of the way across.  Hold down A and press left or right to move the crossfader
all the way to the left or all the way to the right.  When you move to a control element on
the screen or alter one's value, the latest value is displayed in the VL box.

Hold down B and press up, down, left, or right to adjust the MIDI channel you want to send
data on.  The current MIDI channel you are sending data to is displayed in the CH box.

Press Select and Start to switch between the different hardware emulations.

Future versions of this program should include support for Gameboy port-to-MIDI port cables
and possibly Gameboy port-to-USB cables.  This version uses the Gameboy port-to-parallel
port cable simply because one was immediately available to me.


[006.008.2006]
A simple Windows application is taking the place of the Microsoft Windows driver in 
the model described above.  This application transposes data from the Gameboy into MIDI 
data that can be sent to any MIDI input configured on the Windows system, including any 
external devices and MIDI Yoke.

The original design is being extended to also emulate two additional Faderfox models.
The Faderfox LD2 emulation is a screen comprised entirely of rotating knobs.   The 
Faderfox DJ1 emulation is a collection of rotating knobs, buttons, and a crossfader 
arranged in a rough estimation of a standard dj mixer.  The Select and Start buttons are 
used to switch between all 3 hardware emulations.
